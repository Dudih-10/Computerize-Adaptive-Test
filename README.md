Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) Simulation in R

📌 Project Overview
    This project implements and evaluates a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) system using R. The simulation is conducted to examine the effectiveness of CAT in estimating examinee ability levels based on eRm package.
    
    The project includes:
    - Simulation of adaptive testing
    - Evaluation of estimation accuracy
    - Assessment of stopping rules
    - Individual-level simulation analysis
